An example is Private Ben Weilder, who was a soldier.When the war started many jewish people in Canada enlisted in the war efforts from public encouragement,and a few may have fought because of the things they heard that Hitler was doing.Jewish people fought bravely in the war. ","Jewish people started to immigrate to Canada from 1869 to 1947,and setteled near Qubec City,and later Toronto","Before Britain colonized New France the Jewish People lived in places that New France had not colonized.This was  because it was forbidden for anyone that was not Catholic.However,when Britain colonized New France,the Jewish People started immigrating to Canada.The numbers increased a lot after the WWII ended and they started coming to Canada,the USA,and Britan.","Many people left europe because of WWII and Hitler.A lot of people were devastated after the events of the concentration camps and were looking to make a new life after the camps,so ind hope of a better life,they moved to Canada."
,"Jewish People speak Yiddish,made synagogeus and are a strong comminuty, but they face anti-semetisim around the globe and it is unacceptable that they have to face this.There are still some people that think that Hitler was right,even though he wasnâ€™t."];
